What Is Prism Central
---------------------

Overview
++++++++

Nutanix Prism provides central access for administrators to configure, monitor, and manage virtual environments.

Powered by advanced data analytics, heuristics, and rich automation, Prism offers unprecedented simplicity by combining several aspects of datacenter management into a single, consumer-grade solution.

Using innovative machine learning technology, Prism can mine large volumes of system data easily and quickly and generate actionable insights for optimizing all aspects of virtual infrastructure management.

Prism is a part of every Nutanix deployment and has two core components: Prism Element and Prism Central. Prism Element is a service built into the platform for every Nutanix cluster deployed. It provides the ability to fully configure, manage, and monitor Nutanix clusters running any hypervisor.

As organizations deploy multiple Nutanix clusters, they want to be able to manage all of them from a single Prism instance, so Nutanix introduced Prism Central.

This global management experience offers a single place to monitor performance, health, and inventory for all Nutanix clusters. Prism Central is available in a standard version included with every Nutanix deployment and as a Pro version that is licensed separately and enables several advanced features.
